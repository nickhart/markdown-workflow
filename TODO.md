## üìù Implementation Notes

### Development Phases

1. **Phase 1**: Core workflow distribution (create, pack, import)
2. **Phase 2**: Public repository infrastructure
3. **Phase 3**: Advanced features and UI
4. **Phase 4**: Community and collaboration features

### Technical Decisions

- Use semantic versioning for workflows
- Support both local and remote workflow repositories
- Ensure backward compatibility during updates
- Implement proper error handling and recovery

### Community Considerations

- Open source workflow repository
- Clear licensing for community workflows
- Moderation and quality control
- Documentation standards for workflows
