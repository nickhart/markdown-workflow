  - [ ] Document common use cases and workflows

## v1.0.0 Feature Scope

### ‚úÖ Included
- **Core Workflow Engine** - Template processing, status management, collection tracking
- **Job Application Workflow** - Full lifecycle from creation to archival
- **CLI Interface** - All essential commands (init, create, status, list, format, add, update, migrate)
- **Template System** - Mustache-based templates with project overrides
- **Web Scraping** - Simple and reliable URL scraping for job descriptions
- **Document Generation** - Markdown to DOCX conversion via pandoc
- **Testing** - Comprehensive unit and E2E test coverage
- **Project Structure** - Repository-agnostic design like git

### ‚ùå Deferred to Future Versions
- **Blog workflow** (templates exist but CLI integration incomplete)
- **REST API** (code exists but not tested/documented)
- **Web interface** (Next.js scaffold exists but not implemented)
- **Workflow distribution system** (create/pack/import workflows)
- **Public workflow repository**
- **Advanced features** (search, migrate between workflows, etc.)

## Post-v1.0 Roadmap

### v1.1.0 - Blog Workflow
- Complete blog workflow CLI integration
- Blog-specific commands and status management
- HTML generation and publishing workflow

### v1.2.0 - API & Web Demo
- Stabilize REST API
- Create minimal web demo for blog post
- Basic web interface for workflow demonstration

### v2.0.0 - Distribution System
- Workflow creation and packaging
- Import/export workflows
- Community workflow sharing

## Web Demo MVP Concept

### Minimal Demo Scope
**Goal:** Demonstrate the workflow concept in a browser for blog post

**Features:**
- ‚úÖ **Template Preview** - Show how templates work with variable substitution
- ‚úÖ **Workflow Visualization** - Show status transitions for job applications
- ‚úÖ **Interactive Example** - Let users fill out a form and see generated documents
- ‚ùå **No File System** - Use in-memory storage only
- ‚ùå **No Real PDF/DOCX** - Show markdown preview instead
- ‚ùå **No Web Scraping** - Skip URL features for web demo

### Technical Approach
- **Reuse Core Logic** - Import TypeScript modules from `src/core/`
- **Simple React Interface** - Basic form + preview panes
- **Mock File System** - Use existing mock utilities from tests
- **Static Deployment** - No backend required, pure client-side
- **Template Playground** - Let users edit templates and see results

### Implementation Estimate
- **Time:** 1-2 days for basic demo
- **Dependencies:** React, existing core modules, CSS framework
- **Deployment:** Static site (Vercel, Netlify, GitHub Pages)

## Success Metrics for v1.0

### User Experience
- [ ] New user can get productive in < 5 minutes
- [ ] Installation works on macOS, Linux, Windows
- [ ] Common workflows (create job application, update status) feel natural
- [ ] Error messages are helpful and actionable

### Technical Quality
- [ ] All tests pass consistently
- [ ] CLI performance feels snappy (< 1s for common operations)
- [ ] No known critical bugs
- [ ] Documentation covers all user-facing features

### Blog Post Demo
- [ ] Web demo effectively demonstrates the concept
- [ ] Shows off TypeScript/workflow architecture
- [ ] Provides interactive way to understand the system
- [ ] Keeps complexity minimal (follows simplicity ADR)
