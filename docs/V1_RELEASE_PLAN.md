# V1.0 Release Plan

> **Target**: Professional-grade CLI tool ready for open source publication  
> **Timeline**: 1 week  
> **Philosophy**: Quality over features - ship solid, working functionality

## 🎯 Release Blockers (Must Complete)

### Phase 1: Code Quality Standards ⏳

_Status: In Progress_

- [x] ✅ Consolidate documentation (ROADMAP.md)
- [ ] 🔧 Fix 12 lint warnings (unused variables)
- [ ] 🔧 Add strict TypeScript rules (`no-any`, `prefer-nullish-coalescing`)
- [ ] 🔧 Add Prettier configuration file
- [ ] 🔧 Fix environment initialization error in tests

### Phase 2: Architecture Cleanup

_Estimated: 2-3 hours_

- [ ] 🏗️ Move business logic from `cli/shared/` to `services/`
- [ ] 🏗️ Ensure CLI only handles I/O and console output
- [ ] 🏗️ Mark experimental features (`migrate.ts`) with warnings
- [ ] 🏗️ Add safety confirmations for destructive operations

### Phase 3: User Experience Polish

_Estimated: 1-2 hours_

- [ ] ✨ Review all CLI help text and error messages
- [ ] ✨ Update README with clear installation instructions
- [ ] ✨ Create "Getting Started" guide
- [ ] ✨ Verify global installation works

### Phase 4: Release Preparation

_Estimated: 30 minutes_

- [ ] 📦 Update package.json to version 1.0.0
- [ ] 📦 Create CHANGELOG.md for v1.0.0
- [ ] 📦 Test installation on clean system
- [ ] 📦 Verify all CI checks pass
