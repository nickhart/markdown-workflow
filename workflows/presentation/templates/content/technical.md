## Architecture Diagram

```plantuml:system-architecture
@startuml
!theme plain
skinparam componentStyle rectangle
skinparam defaultFontSize 12

package "Client Layer" {
  [Web Browser] as browser
  [Mobile App] as mobile
}

package "API Gateway" {
  [Load Balancer] as lb
  [API Gateway] as gateway
  [Authentication] as auth
}

package "Services" {
  [User Service] as userSvc
  [Business Service] as bizSvc
  [Notification Service] as notifSvc
}

package "Data Layer" {
  database "Primary DB" as db
  database "Cache" as cache
  cloud "File Storage" as storage
}

browser --> lb
mobile --> lb
lb --> gateway
gateway --> auth
gateway --> userSvc
gateway --> bizSvc
gateway --> notifSvc

userSvc --> db
bizSvc --> db
bizSvc --> cache
notifSvc --> storage

## Data Flow

```plantuml:data-flow
@startuml
!theme plain

actor User
participant "Frontend" as FE
participant "API Gateway" as GW
participant "Service Layer" as SVC
participant "Database" as DB
participant "Cache" as CACHE

User -> FE: Request data
FE -> GW: API call
GW -> SVC: Route request
SVC -> CACHE: Check cache
alt Cache hit
  CACHE -> SVC: Return cached data
else Cache miss
  SVC -> DB: Query database
  DB -> SVC: Return data
  SVC -> CACHE: Update cache
end
SVC -> GW: Response
GW -> FE: JSON response
FE -> User: Display data

@enduml
```

## Service Interactions

```plantuml:service-interactions
@startuml
!theme plain

participant "User Service" as US
participant "Auth Service" as AS
participant "Business Service" as BS
participant "Notification Service" as NS
participant "Audit Service" as AUS

US -> AS: Validate token
AS -> US: Token valid
US -> BS: Process request
BS -> AUS: Log action
BS -> NS: Send notification
NS -> AUS: Log notification
BS -> US: Operation complete
US -> AS: Update session

## Database Schema

```plantuml:database-schema
@startuml
!theme plain

entity "users" {
  * id : UUID
  --
  * email : VARCHAR(255)
  * password_hash : VARCHAR(255)
  * created_at : TIMESTAMP
  * updated_at : TIMESTAMP
}

entity "profiles" {
  * id : UUID
  --
  * user_id : UUID (FK)
  * first_name : VARCHAR(100)
  * last_name : VARCHAR(100)
  * avatar_url : VARCHAR(500)
}

entity "posts" {
  * id : UUID
  --
  * author_id : UUID (FK)
  * title : VARCHAR(255)
  * content : TEXT
  * status : ENUM
  * published_at : TIMESTAMP
}

users ||--|| profiles : has
users ||--o{ posts : creates

## Security Model

### Authentication Flow

```plantuml:auth-flow
@startuml
!theme plain

actor User
participant "Frontend" as FE
participant "Auth Service" as AUTH
participant "JWT Store" as JWT
participant "User Service" as US

User -> FE: Login request
FE -> AUTH: Credentials
AUTH -> US: Validate user
US -> AUTH: User valid
AUTH -> JWT: Generate token
JWT -> AUTH: JWT token
AUTH -> FE: Return token
FE -> User: Login success

note over JWT
  Tokens expire in 24h
  Refresh tokens valid 30 days
end note

@enduml
```

### Authorization Matrix

| Role  | Read Users | Create Posts | Admin Panel |
| ----- | ---------- | ------------ | ----------- |
| Guest | ❌         | ❌           | ❌          |
| User  | ✅         | ✅           | ❌          |
| Admin | ✅         | ✅           | ✅          |

## Performance Considerations

### Caching Strategy

- **L1 Cache**: In-memory application cache (5 min TTL)
- **L2 Cache**: Redis distributed cache (1 hour TTL)
- **CDN**: Static assets cached globally (24 hours)

### Scalability Patterns

```plantuml:scaling-pattern
@startuml
!theme plain

package "Load Balancing" {
  [Load Balancer] --> [App Server 1]
  [Load Balancer] --> [App Server 2]
  [Load Balancer] --> [App Server N]
}

package "Database Scaling" {
  [Master DB] --> [Read Replica 1]
  [Master DB] --> [Read Replica 2]
}

package "Caching" {
  [Redis Cluster] --> [Redis Node 1]
  [Redis Cluster] --> [Redis Node 2]
}

@enduml
```

## Deployment Architecture

```plantuml:deployment
@startuml
!theme plain

node "Production Environment" {
  package "Kubernetes Cluster" {
    [Frontend Pods] as FE
    [API Pods] as API
    [Worker Pods] as WORKER
  }

  database "PostgreSQL" as DB
  database "Redis" as CACHE
  cloud "S3 Storage" as S3
}

node "Monitoring" {
  [Prometheus] as PROM
  [Grafana] as GRAF
  [AlertManager] as ALERT
}

FE --> API
API --> DB
API --> CACHE
API --> S3
WORKER --> DB

API --> PROM : metrics
PROM --> GRAF : visualization
PROM --> ALERT : alerts

@enduml
```

## Migration Strategy

### Phase 1: Infrastructure

- Set up new environments
- Migrate core services
- Establish monitoring

### Phase 2: Data Migration

- Export existing data
- Transform and validate
- Import to new system

### Phase 3: Cutover

- Blue-green deployment
- Traffic switching
- Rollback plan ready

---

## Monitoring & Observability

### Key Metrics

- **Availability**: 99.9% uptime SLA
- **Performance**: < 200ms API response time
- **Throughput**: 10,000 requests/minute capacity

### Alerting Rules

- High error rate (> 5%)
- Slow response time (> 500ms)
- Database connection issues
- Memory usage > 80%

## Risk Assessment

| Risk             | Impact | Probability | Mitigation                  |
| ---------------- | ------ | ----------- | --------------------------- |
| Database failure | High   | Low         | Read replicas, backups      |
| Service overload | Medium | Medium      | Auto-scaling, rate limiting |
| Security breach  | High   | Low         | OAuth, encryption, auditing |
